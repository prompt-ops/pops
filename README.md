# ü§ñ Prompt-Ops

**PromptOps** is a CLI tool that lets you interact with your infrastructure‚Äîlike Kubernetes clusters, databases, and cloud environments‚Äîusing natural language. Instead of memorizing commands and juggling multiple tools, you can simply ‚Äúask‚Äù for what you need in plain English, and PromptOps will translate your request into the right kubectl commands, SQL queries, or cloud CLI instructions. With built-in interactive flows, suggested next steps, and support for various connection types, PromptOps streamlines operations, saves time, and makes managing complex systems more intuitive.
